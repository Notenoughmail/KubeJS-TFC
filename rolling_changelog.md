- Fix custom fauna registrations causing *certain mods* to crash because they do not use Forge's event
- Changes to `TFCEvents.registerFaunas`
    - Deprecate `.register`, identical function provided by `.replace`
    - Add `.replace`, `.and`, and `.or` methods, these perform the operation their name implies on any existing spawn placements with the fauna based on created through it
        - Have the exact same args as the now-deprecated `.register` method
        - Also have a version with a nullable string arg added after the entity type, this is suffixed to the registered fauna's id with a `/`
- Fix not being able to define portions in the meal ISP modifier
- Fix custom crops having an empty loot table by default
